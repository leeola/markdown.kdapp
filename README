# Markdown Editor

This is a two purpose app.

1. It serves as a useful Markdown editor that automatically compiles your
  markdown to the right.
2. It is very well documented and is a "learning app"

In the future, this app will serve as the basis for a Koding Docs guide which
will cover the creation of this app.
